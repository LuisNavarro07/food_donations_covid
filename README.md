**Abstract** 
We examine the role of charitable food assistance during periods of economic distress by looking at
donations to a large Midwestern food bank. First, we explore the historical determinants of in-kind food and financial donations, 
including during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that both in-kind and financial donations dramatically increased at the onset of the 
pandemic but these increases were not persistent. As a result, we argue that this is evidence of the charitable food system serving as an 
"automatic nutritional stabilizer" in accepting federal provisions and charitable donations on behalf of households in need during times of crisis.
